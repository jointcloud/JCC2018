Enabled by cloud computing, developers are no longer required to purchase and maintain hardware to deploy their software and services, which has rapidly changed the IT industry and shaped the way how software is designed and delivered. The first-generation cloud (referred to as Cloud 1.0 in this proposal) mainly focuses on aggregating large-scale IT resources into a single cloud and providing well-managed, auto-provisioned resources and services. In Cloud 1.0, various forms of computing paradigms, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), have achieved remarkable. However, there has recently been new challenges emerging to cloud computing. First, globalized ecommerce has largely redefined the requirements on cloud computing, and more collaboration is required between individual clouds due to service combination and location-sensitive computation. Second, many cloud-based businesses are experiencing a burst of computation. For example, events like \u201cNovember 11\u201d and \u201cBlack Friday\u201d usually require over 10x more resources than daily operations, creating exhausted pressure to any single cloud provider. Finally, the emerging big data and blockchain applications have brought great challenges to cloud computing performance and provider-cross service collaborations. In this scenario, not only the performance and ease-of-use, but also the trustworthiness of the services is highly urged. To address these challenges, both academia and industry have started to consider the federation and collaboration between individual clouds (referred to as Cloud 2.0). The key feature of Cloud 2.0 is to eliminate the barrier among multiple clouds via joint cloud computing. For example, researchers from Europe have coined the concept of SuperCloud to enable cross-cloud computation migration. Cisco advocates their Intercloud Fabric to enable transparent communication across clouds. Chinese researchers have proposed Internet-based virtual computing environment (iVCE) to provide harmonious, trustworthy and transparent integrated services based on open infrastructures across multiple datacenters and cloud providers. Researchers have also explored the economy of various resource prices in different clouds to save the cost by using cost-aware cross- cloud services. Joint cloud computing (a.k.a. JointCloud ) is a new generation of computing model for Cloud 2.0, which facilitates developers to customize cross-cloud services by means of \u201csoftware definition\u201d based on the integration and cooperation among cloud service entities. The goal of the workshop for JointCloud is to investigate theories and methods of abstracting and aggregating cross-cloud resources, building integrated virtual private clouds, as well as exploring novel applications that leverage JointCloud. Compared to previous efforts in the category of Cloud 2.0, JointCloud not only focuses on a vertical integration of cloud resources but also expects a horizontal cooperation between cloud providers in the form of service-oriented computing.
